Overview
    This Python file provides a function to list files within a specified folder in an AWS S3 bucket. It uses the boto3 library to 
    interact with the S3 service. The file is configured with AWS credentials and bucket/folder information stored in a separate constants file.

Key Components
    s3_client: 
        An S3 client object initialized with AWS access and secret keys. This object is used to interact with the S3 service. 
        Credentials are imported from a constants file.
    list_files_in_folder(bucket_name, folder_name): 
        This function takes the bucket name and folder name as input. It uses s3_client.list_objects_v2() to retrieve a list of objects 
        within the specified folder. It then logs the name and size of each object found. 
        If no objects are found, it logs a message indicating this. Error handling is included to catch and log any exceptions during the process. 
        It relies on the BUCKET_NAME and FOLDER_NAME constants for default values.
    constants import: 
        This file imports necessary credentials (ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY) and S3 location information (BUCKET_NAME, FOLDER_NAME) used to 
        configure the S3 client and specify the target location. This suggests a practice of separating sensitive information from the 
        main code for better security and maintainability.
    Logging: 
        The code uses the logging module to provide information about the files found or any errors encountered. 
        This is crucial for monitoring and debugging.

# Hey there - I've reviewed your changes and found some issues that need to be addressed.

# Blocking issues:

# Avoid hardcoding AWS credentials directly in the code (e:_UNHCR\CODE\unhcr_module\unhcr\s3.py:6)
# Overall Comments:

# Storing AWS credentials in constants is not secure. Consider using AWS credentials provider chain, environment variables, or AWS IAM roles instead.
# The docstring is floating and not properly attached to the function it documents. Move it directly above the function definition.
# Here's what I looked at during the review
# 游리 General issues: 1 issue found
# 游댮 Security: 1 blocking issue, 1 other issue
# 游릭 Testing: all looks good
# 游릭 Complexity: all looks good
# 游릭 Documentation: all looks good

# suggestion(security): Use more specific exception handling instead of broad Exception catch
#         Exception: If there is an issue connecting to S3 or listing the files.
